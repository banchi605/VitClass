    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things don't work out as planned. This had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it. 
        He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come to terms with it. Or at least he thought he had. All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it and 
        the engine didn't make a sound.</p> </div>

        <h3>Part 2</h3>
        <p class="bet">He had disappointed himself more than anyone else. That wasn't to say that he hadn't disappointed others. The fact was that he had disappointed a lot of people who 
            were close to him. The fact that they were disappointed in him was something that made him even more disappointed in himself. Yet here he was, about to do the exact same things
             that had caused all the disappointment in the first place because he didn't know what else to do.</p></div>
