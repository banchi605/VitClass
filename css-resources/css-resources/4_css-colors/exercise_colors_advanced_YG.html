<!-- Exercise: Advanced CSS Color Styling -->

<!-- Your task is to create a styles.css file and apply advanced color styles to different elements using CSS. Here are the specific tasks:

Select the h1 element and apply a gradient color from red to blue.
Select all paragraphs and set the text color using an RGBA value for semi-transparency.
Select the paragraph with the class 'important' and change its background color using a CSS variable.
Select the li elements within the ul and set their text color to a lighter shade using the lighten color function (you may need a preprocessor for this).
Select the link (a) and change its text color to purple on hover, with a transition effect.
Use CSS comments to describe what each rule does.
Create a styles.css file to apply these advanced color styles to the HTML elements. -->
