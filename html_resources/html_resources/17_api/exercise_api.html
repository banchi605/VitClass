<!-- Exercise: Create a Location-Based Reminder Application using HTML5 APIs.

In this exercise, you'll create a basic web application that allows users to set reminders associated with specific geographic locations. You will use the Geolocation API to get the user's current location and the Local Storage API to store and retrieve reminders. -->

<!-- Start with the basic HTML structure, including <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

    In the <head>, set the character encoding to UTF-8 and provide a meaningful title for the page, such as "Location Reminder App."
    
    Create a form in the <body> that includes the following elements:
    
    An input field for the user to enter a reminder message.
    A button to set a reminder at the current location.
    A list to display reminders.
    Implement JavaScript code to use the Geolocation API to get the user's current latitude and longitude.
    
    When the user clicks the "Set Reminder" button, capture the reminder message and the user's current location.
    
    Store the reminder message and location data in the Local Storage.
    
    Create a function to retrieve reminders from the Local Storage and display them in the list.
    
    For each reminder, display the message and provide a way to remove reminders from the list. -->
