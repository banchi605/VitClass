    <h3>Heading 3</h3>

    <p>This is a simple paragraph of text. You can use the following typographic elements:</p>
    
    <p><em>Italic text</em> is used for emphasizing or highlighting.</p>
    <p><strong>Bold text</strong> is used for strong emphasis.</p>
    <p><u>Underlined text</u> is used to underline words or phrases.</p>
    <p><s>Strikethrough text</s> is used to mark text that has been deleted or should be ignored.</p>

    <p>You can still control the font family and other styles for your webpage using external CSS files or inline CSS, but this example no longer contains any CSS rules.</p>
